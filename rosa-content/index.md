## Overview
Welcome, Red Hatters supporting FBI!

Join your friendly NAPS Ministriy of Hyperscalers for a hands-on workshop with Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA). 

During the event, your Ministry of Hyperscaler SMEs (Superficially-Minded Entertainers) and other Red Hat Cloud Services experts will guide you through the ROSA architecture and will answer your questions. 

**Who should attend:** This two-day, in-person workshop is ideal for **Consulting Architects, Solution Architects, Technical Account Managers and _talented_ SSPs** who need to develop an understanding of how to build, deploy and scale applications on ROSA.

**What to expect:** During the workshop, we will take you through a series of content to help you understand some of the concepts of deploying container-based applications on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS and how to operate an Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS cluster. We will cover the following:

- Complete Day 2 operations tasks such as configuring node and cluster scaling policies, configuring managed upgrades, and using labels for deterministic app placement on nodes
- Deploy an application using CI/CD tooling, including OpenShift GitOps and Source-to-Image
- Deploy an application that uses an Amazon DynamoDB table
- Make an application on OpenShift scalable and resistant to node failures and upgrades
- Learn how to use OpenShift Service Mesh for application observability and tracing

Get experience with, and an informed view of Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS.
